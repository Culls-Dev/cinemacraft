# CinemaCraft
The CinemaCraft resource pack adds many amazing features to the game, like improved UI, and better grass textures! This was first meant as a challenge, but I have decided to post it anyways!

# Installing
## ⚠️ Important Note
Always ensure the resource pack version matches your game version (e.g., a 1.20 pack for Minecraft 1.20).

***

## Method 1: Installing via the Resource Pack Folder (Java Edition)

This is the most common method for Java Edition.

1.  **Download the resource pack!**

2.  **Open Minecraft:** Launch the Minecraft game and navigate to the main menu.

3.  **Go to Options:** Click the **"Options..."** button.

4.  **Open Resource Packs Menu:** Click the **"Resource Packs..."** button.

5.  **Open Pack Folder:** Click the **"Open Pack Folder"** button at the bottom left. This will open a new window showing your `resourcepacks` directory.

6.  **Move the File:** Drag and drop the downloaded `.zip` file into this opened `resourcepacks` folder.

7.  **Activate the Pack:** Close and re-open the "Resource Packs" menu in Minecraft. Your new pack should appear in the **"Available Resource Packs"** list on the left.

8.  **Enable:** Click the arrow icon on the pack's icon to move it to the **"Selected Resource Packs"** list on the right.

9.  **Enjoy:** Click **"Done"** to load the textures. The game may pause briefly.
