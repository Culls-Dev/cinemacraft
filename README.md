# CinemaCraft
The CinemaCraft resource pack adds many amazing features to the game, like improved UI, and better grass textures! This was first meant as a challenge, but I have decided to post it anyways!

# Installing
## ⚠️ Important Note
Always ensure the resource pack version matches your game version (e.g., a 1.20 pack for Minecraft 1.20).

***

## Method 1: Installing via the Resource Pack Folder (Java Edition)

This is the most common method for Java Edition.

1.  **Download a Resource Pack:** Find and download a resource pack file (usually a `.zip` file) from a trusted source (e.g., CurseForge, Planet Minecraft). **Do not unzip the file.**

2.  **Open Minecraft:** Launch the Minecraft game and navigate to the main menu.

3.  **Go to Options:** Click the **"Options..."** button.

4.  **Open Resource Packs Menu:** Click the **"Resource Packs..."** button.

5.  **Open Pack Folder:** Click the **"Open Pack Folder"** button at the bottom left. This will open a new window showing your `resourcepacks` directory.

6.  **Move the File:** Drag and drop the downloaded `.zip` file into this opened `resourcepacks` folder.

7.  **Activate the Pack:** Close and re-open the "Resource Packs" menu in Minecraft. Your new pack should appear in the **"Available Resource Packs"** list on the left.

8.  **Enable:** Click the arrow icon on the pack's icon to move it to the **"Selected Resource Packs"** list on the right.

9.  **Enjoy:** Click **"Done"** to load the textures. The game may pause briefly.

## Method 2: Double-Clicking (Bedrock Edition/Windows 10/11)

For Windows 10/11 Bedrock Edition users, resource packs often come in an easy-to-install format (`.mcpack` or `.mcaddon`).

1.  **Download the Pack:** Download the resource pack file. It should end with `.mcpack` or `.mcaddon`.

2.  **Ensure Minecraft is Closed:** Make sure your Minecraft application is completely closed.

3.  **Double-Click the File:** Simply double-click the downloaded `.mcpack` or `.mcaddon` file.

4.  **Automatic Import:** Minecraft will launch automatically and begin importing the pack. A "Pack Import Started" message will appear at the top of your screen, followed by a "Successfully Imported" message.

5.  **Activate In-Game:**
    *   **Global Activation:** Go to **"Settings"** > **"Global Resources"** under the "General" tab. Select the pack under **"Available"** and click **"Activate"**.
    *   **World-Specific:** Edit an existing world's settings and apply the pack under the "Add-Ons" section.
